Examples are\n\n- user input\n- data arriving from a server\n- a timer completing\n\nThere are 2 types of sources: Sources created from existing observables, and sources created from the [`Source`](/concepts/sources#source) class (similar to RxJS `Subject`).\n\nSources should be named after events, not commands. For example, rather than naming a source `changeName$`, consider naming it `nameChange$` or `nameChanged$`. In reactive programming, data flows in one direction, and giving a source the name of a command puts implicit knowledge about what happens _downstream_ from the source into the source itself. It is a subtle but important change of mindset from traditional, imperative programming.\n\n## `toSource`\n\n[`toSource`](/concepts/sources#tosource) is an observable operator that converts an existing observable into a source. It takes one argument: the action type that will be displayed in Redux Devtools. The only purpose of the action type is to appear in Redux Devtools to help developers understand what is taking place in the application, so you can name it whatever you want.\n\nExample:\n\n```typescript\nimport { timer } from 'rxjs';\nimport { toSource } from '@state-adapt/core';\n\nconst timer$ = timer(3000).pipe(toSource('timer$'));\n```\n\n![Action Type in Redux Devtools](../assets/timer$.png)\n\n(Note: This will not occur until you use the source in a store and subscribe to its state.)\n\nInternally, `toSource` just maps values to action objects that are similar to Redux actions.\n\n## `Source`\n\nWhen you don't have an observable already, you can use a [`Source`](/concepts/sources#source) the same way you would use an RxJS `Subject`. The most common use case for this is to represent user input in a component:\n\n```html\n<button (click)=\"formSubmission$.next()\">Submit</button>\n```\n\n```typescript\nimport { Source } from '@state-adapt/core';\n// ...\nformSubmission$ = new Source<void>('formSubmission$');\n```\n\nThe argument is the action type that will show up in Redux Devtools.\n\nSimilar to [`toSource`](/concepts/sources#tosource), [`Source`](/concepts/sources#source) wraps values pushed into it in objects similar to Redux actions.\n\n## `splitSources`\n\nSome observables are actually several event types merged together. Although it will depend on how you write your state adapters, you will probably want only one event type per source. You could just `filter` for each event type and then use [`toSource`](/concepts/sources#tosource) on each filtered stream, but StateAdapt provides a [`splitSources`](/concepts/sources#splitsources) function that might help. Here is how it can be used:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Observable } from 'rxjs';\nimport { splitSources } from '@state-adapt/core';\n\nenum MessageType {\n  MESSAGE_1 = 'MESSAGE_1',\n  MESSAGE_2 = 'MESSAGE_2',\n}\n\ninterface Message1 {\n  type: MessageType.MESSAGE_1;\n}\n\ninterface Message2 {\n  type: MessageType.MESSAGE_2;\n  data: string;\n}\n\ntype WebsocketMessage = Message1 | Message2;\n\nconst websocketMessages$: Observable<WebsocketMessage> = of(\n  Math.random() < 0.5\n    ? { type: MessageType.MESSAGE_1 }\n    : { type: MessageType.MESSAGE_2, data: 'asdfasdf' },\n);\n\nconst { message1$, message2$ } = splitSources(websocketMessages$, {\n  message1$: MessageType.MESSAGE_1, // matches against message.type\n  message2$: MessageType.MESSAGE_2,\n});\n\n// Correctly infers the type of message1$ as Observable<Message1>\n// You can now apply toSource to each stream\n```\n\nSince [`splitSources`](/concepts/sources#splitsources) matches against the `type` property of the values emitted from the observable passed into it, you can easily pass in an observable of actual StateAdapt sources and they will come out the other side as sources still. However, when all the messages in the input observable do _not_ fit the StateAdapt/Redux `Action` interface, you will have to use [`toSource`](/concepts/sources#tosource) to convert them, as mentioned in that example.\n\n## `getAction`\n\nThis is a function that takes in 2 arguments (an `actionType` and an optional `payload`) and creates a StateAdapt `Action`. So, in this example `source1$` and `source2$` are equivalent:\n\n```typescript\nimport { of } from 'rxjs';\nimport { map } from 'rxjs/operators';\nimport { toSource, getAction } from '@state-adapt/core';\n\nconst obs$ = of(1);\nconst source1$ = obs$.pipe(toSource('source1$'));\nconst source2$ = obs$.pipe(map(n => getAction('source$2', n)));\n```\n\nThis can give you a little more flexibility when creating sources.\n\n## `getHttpActions`\n\nHttp requests are often just used for the single value they emit when they complete. However, if you want to handle the loading state and errors, http requests become a common example of observables that contain multiple event types in a single observable: `request`, `error` and `success`. `getHttpActions` uses [`getAction`](/concepts/sources#getaction) internally to convert an HTTP request observable into an observable of those 3 actions. Example usage:\n\n```typescript\nimport { getHttpActions } from '@state-adapt/core';\n\nconst fetchData = (filters: Filters) =>\n  timer(2000).pipe(mapTo({ body: 'Some data', status: 200, error: null }));\n\nconst httpActions$ = filters$.pipe(\n  // filters$ is just some observable of filters that triggers re-fetch\n  switchMap(filters =>\n    getHttpActions(\n      fetchData(filters),\n      res => [res.status === 200, res.body, res.error],\n      filters,\n    ),\n  ),\n);\n```\n\nThere is a lot going on here.\n\nThe 1st argument of [`getHttpActions`](/concepts/sources#gethttpactions) is an observable (the http request).\n\nThe 2nd argument is a function you need to provide that takes in the value emitted by the observable passed in the 1st argument and returns an array containing 3 elements:\n\n1. A boolean that is true if the request was successful\n2. The value you want as the payload of the `Success` action\n3. The error message from the response\n\n[`getHttpActions`](/concepts/sources#gethttpactions) also applies a `catchError` RxJS operator and maps it to the `Error` source, so the type emitted by the `Error` source is `string | Err`, where `Err` is whatever you typed it as in your observable.\n\nThe 3rd argument is optional and will be part of the `request$` and `error$` actions. If you provide this argument, then whatever you provided for the error in the 2nd argument will end up getting wrapped in an array with it. So in this example, the error action payload would be of type `[string | typeof res.error, Filters]`, and the request action payload would be `Filters` instead of `void`. If you didn't provide a 3rd argument, the error action payload would be of type `string | typeof res.error` and the request action payload would be `void`.\n\nTypically you will call [`splitHttpSources`](/concepts/sources#splitsources) after [`getHttpActions`](/concepts/sources#gethttpactions) to split it into 3 separate sources: `request$`, `success$` and `error$`.\n\nBut for many HTTP sources you will not have to use [`getHttpActions`](/concepts/sources#gethttpactions) directly. If you are creating an inner observable, you will probably use it, because each new request needs to start with a `request$` action. However, if you are not creating an inner observable, you can just use [`getHttpSources`](/concepts/sources#gethttpsources), which combines [`getHttpActions`](/concepts/sources#gethttpactions) and [`splitHttpSources`](/concepts/sources#splithttpsources).\n\n## `splitHttpSources`\n\nThe 1st argument is the scope. Whatever you pass in here, [`splitHttpSources`](/concepts/sources#splithttpsources) will append `' request$'`, `' success$'` and `' error$'` to it in the actions that it creates with [`getAction`](/concepts/sources#getaction). So if you pass in `'[Some Data]'`, the action types of the sources will be `'[Some Data] request$'`, `'[Some Data] success$'` and `'[Some Data] error$'`.\n\nThe 2nd argument is the observable of all HTTP actions, which is what [`getHttpActions`](/concepts/sources#gethttpactions) returns.\n\n## `getHttpSources`\n\n[`getHttpSources`](/concepts/sources#gethttpsources) is a combination of [`getHttpActions`](/concepts/sources#gethttpactions) and [`splitHttpSources`](/concepts/sources#splithttpsources). Here is an example of two ways that are equivalent:\n\n```typescript\nimport { getHttpActions, splitSources, getHttpSources } from '@state-adapt/core';\n\nconst fetchData = () =>\n  timer(2000).pipe(mapTo({ body: 'Some data', status: 200, error: null }));\n\n// 1. getHttpActions + splitSources\nconst httpActions$ = getHttpActions(this.fetchData(), res => [\n  res.status === 200,\n  res.body,\n  res.error,\n]);\nconst { request$, success$, error$ } = splitHttpSources('[Some Data]', httpActions$);\n\n// 2. getHttpSoures\nconst { request$, success$, error$ } = getHttpSources(\n  '[Some Data]',\n  this.fetchData(),\n  res => [res.status === 200, res.body, res.error],\n);\n```\n\n## One Source Per Event\n\nIn reactive programming, data flows in one direction, so each source represents a single kind of event. Rather than handling an event in a callback function, you should directly push the event into a single source and handle downstream effects in the affected features themselves.\n\nBad example:\n\n```html\n\x3c!-- DO NOT DO THIS --\x3e\n<button (click)=\"onFormSubmit()\">Submit</button>\n```\n\n```typescript\nimport { Source } from '@state-adapt/core';\n// ... DO NOT DO THIS\nsubmitForm$ = new Source<FormData>('submitForm$');\nresetForm$ = new Source<void>('resetForm$');\n// ... DO NOT DO THIS\nonFormSubmit() {\n  this.submitForm$.next(this.form.value);\n  this.resetForm$.next();\n}\n```\n\nGood example:\n\n```html\n\x3c!-- DO THIS --\x3e\n<button (click)=\"formSubmission$.next()\">Submit</button>\n```\n\n```typescript\nimport { Source } from '@state-adapt/core';\n// ... DO THIS\nformSubmission$ = new Source<void>('formSubmission$'); // or formSubmitted$\n```\n\nThere might be numerous states that are impacted by a single event. You should still only create a single source for this event and handle downstream effects in the affected features themselves.\n\nInternally, StateAdapt checks each source you pass into the `init` method to see if you have passed it into the `init` method at any time before. If you have, it doesn't subscribe to the same source again; it just adds its state changes to the list of state changes to apply whenever the first source emits.\n\nThe benefit of doing it this way is that you only see one action dispatched in Redux Devtools for each event that occurs in the app, even if dozens of stores are listening to it. They all get piled onto the same action for Redux Devtools.\n\nThe drawback is rare, but it does occur: Since we only subscribe to the first observable, cold observables like those created from `of` and `timer` that you would expect to fire for each individual store that uses them will actually only fire for the first store that uses that exact observable reference. The solution? Just create a new reference for each store that uses it. This can be achieved either through a factory function, such as `getTimer = () => timer(5000)`, or by wrapping the reference in a `defer()` when passing it into another store (simply calling `.pipe()` on an observable doesn't seem to create a new reference, so that doesn't work). There might be a more clever workaround, but these work.\n\nThis situation is rare and the benefit of having 1 action in Redux Devtools per event is well worth this drawback. But it is good to know about so you can deal with it when you come across it.\n\n## Synthetic Sources\n\nIt is generally safer to define sources as close as possible to where the events themselves are emitted from. For example, if you are creating a source for a button click, you should prefer defining it right in the same component as the button itself, or at least in a service that is dedicated to that component.\n\nBut we can't easily refer directly to the DOM nodes themselves in our TypeScript, which is what would really be ideal. So, there will always be a separate reference we use instead. It could be created with [`Source`](/concepts/sources#source). Or, if only one store is interested in our source, why not let the store provide some default sources our templates can refer to directly?\n\nThis is okay as long as we clearly understand that as soon as a 2nd store becomes interested in that DOM event, we create a dedicated source for that event, using [`Source`](/concepts/sources#source).\n\nThe simple rule to follow is this: Don't write callback functions (or event handlers). They are just containers for imperative code. Instead, push a minimal update from the template to a single place in TypeScript, and let everything downstream take responsibility for itself and react if necessary.\n"}}return s.\u0275fac=function(o){return new(o||s)},s.\u0275cmp=e.Xpm({type:s,selectors:[["state-adapt-sources"]],standalone:!0,features:[e.jDz],decls:6,vars:2,consts:[[3,"data"],["link","/concepts/overview"],["link","/concepts/adapters",3,"right"]],template:function(o,l){1&o&&(e.TgZ(0,"state-adapt-content"),e._UZ(1,"markdown",0),e.TgZ(2,"state-adapt-nav-tile",1),e._uU(3,"Overview"),e.qZA(),e.TgZ(4,"state-adapt-nav-tile",2),e._uU(5," Adapters "),e.qZA()()),2&o&&(e.xp6(1),e.Q6J("data",l.md),e.xp6(3),e.Q6J("right",!0))},dependencies:[c.S,r.JP,r.lF,u.c],encapsulation:2}),s})()}}]);
